# Changelog — harness (formerly harness-slim)

All notable changes to `harness-slim` templates and mirrored rules. Agent reads only entries between installed repo marker and current skill `metadata.json` version.

Maintainer rule: every change that affects `templates/*` or rules mirrored into `AGENTS.md`/`init.sh` must bump `metadata.json` version and add an entry here. Archive old majors to `CHANGELOG.archive.md` when this file exceeds ~2 major versions.

Types: `breaking-rules` (AGENTS.md rules), `breaking-script` (init.sh structure), `additive` (new field/section), `non-breaking-doc` (skill-side docs only, no repo action).

## 2.1.0

| Change | Artifact | Type | Update action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bundled task readiness CLI (`task-ready.mjs`) | `scripts/task-ready.mjs` | additive | Run `node <harness-path>/scripts/task-ready.mjs [tasks/]` (or `--json`, `--all`) to inspect active work and unblocked `todo` candidates without loading all task files into context. Validates graph cycles, missing dependencies, and duplicate IDs. |
| Contextual task readiness guidance in AGENTS router | `templates/agents.md` §Concurrent work | additive | Update router to advise running `task-ready.mjs` when asked what to do next or choosing unblocked work; skip when working on an assigned task; clarify that technical readiness does not bypass user approval. |
| Task dependency syntax hint in template | `templates/task-template.md` | additive | Add format guidance comment above `Required to start`: `'none'`, `'[Title](task-<slug>.md)'`, or manual gate text. Non-task links and external gates are recognized as manual review conditions. |
| Task coordination intake guidance | `skills/harness-task/SKILL.md`, `skills/harness/SKILL.md` | non-breaking-doc | Reference `task-ready.mjs` for checking unblocked candidates during task sizing and backlog triage. |

## 2.0.0

Breaking update. Migrate managed repositories only with approval using
[the migration guide](references/migration-v2.md); do not regenerate or delete history.

| Change | Artifact | Type | Update action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Skill names become `harness` and `harness-review` | Skill packages/invocations | breaking-rules | Update installed selections and live routes; repository URL unchanged |
| Tasks replace feature index and shared progress | `tasks/task-<slug>.md`, optional `tasks/index.md`, `AGENTS.md` | breaking-rules | Move canonical execution state to tasks/tracker; index is roadmap only; preserve old history |
| Task-local ownership/concurrency and dependency gates | Task, router | breaking-rules | Remove global active limit/counter; distinguish start vs integrate/release gates |
| Inline plans by default; no numeric thresholds or mandatory microsteps | Planning skills/task | breaking-rules | Keep adequate native paths; separate plan only for coordination, sequencing, or recovery |
| Sequential check-only Bash wrapper | `init.sh` | breaking-script | Replace arrays/scheduler/fix commands with observed root check or explicit checks; expose coverage gaps |
| Read-only docs drift/simplicity assessment | `agent-docs-checker` | additive | Install only when needed; no mandatory audit pipeline |
| Task closure extracts durable knowledge; archive selectively | Task/router | breaking-rules | Check links, consumers, dependents, and retention before removal |

## 1.4.0 — 2026-08-21

| Change | Artifact | Type | Update action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Feature-tracking decision table (No feature / Inline / External with >=2 signals) | `templates/agents.md` (Plans) + `SKILL.md` §Create or update artifacts | breaking-rules | Replace the two `Plans` bullets in `AGENTS.md` with the 3-row decision table from `SKILL.md`. Do not create `docs/plans/` for bounded work. |
| `init.sh` BUILD/TEST guard (fail if no BUILD/TEST tasks while evidence exists) | `templates/init.sh` | breaking-script | Insert guard block after `MAX_JOBS` validation: `if [ "${#BUILD_TASKS[@]}" -eq 0 ] && [ "${#TEST_TASKS[@]}" -eq 0 ]; then echo FAIL...; exit 2; fi`. Do not modify task arrays. |
| Slim `references/gotchas.md` to 5 core failure modes, archive 15 to `gotchas-full.md` | `references/gotchas.md` | non-breaking-doc | none — skill-side reference only, no repo change |

Notes: repos with marker `<!-- harness-slim 1.3.x -->` or earlier should apply both breaking rows above with surgical edits and user approval.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-08-15 (example placeholder for prior baseline)

- Initial slim baseline before 1.4.0. Future entries follow same table format.
